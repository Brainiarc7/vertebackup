==== vertebackup: The backbone of your backup scheme! ====

Snazzy rotating system-level backups using rsync and hard links.  Lame name, cool script.  All the cool names were taken.

=== Usage ===
vertebackup takes one argument, the UUID of the partition where your backups will live.  You can find the UUID of your
partition with the `blkid` tool (make sure the disk is plugged in!).

Make sure the disk is plugged in and partition mounted, then initial a backup like so:
	sudo ./vertebackup.sh 070796a9-0e27-43e3-8fab-7eaa940e2dec

=== Notes ===
The script will try to reduce impact of IO on user responsiveness by running the script with `ionice`.  If your system
doesn't have this tool installed the script will fail.  Just do yourself a favor and install it, in Ubuntu it is in the
package `util-linux`.
